    "desc": "Warning\n: if you\u2019re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we\u2019re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.\nWanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we\u2019re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we\u2019re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.\nOur founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We\u2019re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.\nWe now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 6, including 5 engineers hailing from Yale, University of Toronto, UCLA, and more; and 1 designer. We\u2019re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.\nWe also love traveling. Whether it\u2019s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team\u2019s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We\u2019re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\nAs an engineer, you\u2019ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You\u2019ll be expected to:\nBuild new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.)\nDesign and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won\u2019t be handed a spec; you\u2019ll be coming up with it!\nBuild data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web.\nWrite tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested.\nDebug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows.\nReview code written by other engineers.\nBe fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.\nThis position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.\nWhat You Might Work On\nNew, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier.\nAI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention.\nImprovements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones.\nA Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels.\nBetter invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them.\nA better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they\u2019ve been, see how many people they\u2019ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.\nYou May Be a Good Fit If You\nAre a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native.\nAre a product person: you\u2019ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them.\nAre comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too.\nAre entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats.\nLove travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.\nWhat\u2019s it like to work here?\nWe\u2019re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel\u2019s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week\u2019s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.\nOur values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.\nWe believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.\nOur hiring process\nWe\u2019ll first have you do 2 short rounds of asynchronous programming challenges, including one with a virtual interviewer. After that, we\u2019ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language with one of the founders, followed by a half-day final-round virtual onsite via video call.\nFounders\nPeter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents\u2019 work more productive.\nHarry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.\nBefore building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers\u2019 lives easier!",

    "desc": "At Pylon, we\u2019re a small team building a very ambitious product in the mortgage space.\nAt this early stage, we\u2019re looking for engineers who can see the opportunity of what we\u2019re building towards and want to have a hand in building it.\nWe're in search of people who find difficult problems invigorating and who fit well into a high-performing team built on mutual respect and reliance. If you like pushing yourself to learn a massive amount while shipping code that has a huge impact on the end product, Pylon Engineering could be a great place for you.\nAbout You\nYou:\nHave strong opinions that you\u2019re willing to defend. We have a culture of vigorous discussion and debate on technical decisions. We\u2019ll push you to defend your choices, and we want you to push back. \nDon't settle. Challenge yourself to frequently and consistently deliver exceptional code. If something could be better, take the initiative to improve it. \nHave great ideas, and lots of them. You should see opportunities all around you to make the code, product and infrastructure better. We\u2019ll give you an environment where you can act on those ideas. \nAre self-motivated. You can take a goal and drive towards it without needing extensive hand-holding. The team is supportive and loves to share knowledge and advice, but there\u2019s no time for micromanaging your work. \nAre comfortable with ambiguity. There's a million ways to do things; you should feel at ease making a decision under uncertainty while balancing competing constraints. \nAre confident you can learn quickly. Mortgage is complex, our platform is complex, good software engineering is complex. You\u2019ve got to have an attitude that you can absorb it, get on top of it, and build something better than what came before. \nLove strong typing. We're a team full of people who love Haskell and Rust (and Idris!) and take pride in pushing Typescript to its limits. \nAbout The Team\nWhat we\u2019re not:\nBuilding a CRUD app:\nWe\u2019re building a platform that\u2019s only possible due to deep technology investments and thinking hard from first principles. Cargo-culting what\u2019s come before won\u2019t be sufficient. \nIf you\u2019re looking to do mostly plumbing / lego piece assembling, Pylon may be very frustrating for you\nA ChatGPT wrapper:\nMortgage is a sprawling mess of problems, and there isn't one tool that solves every one of them. We use LLMs, but we've reached for tools in multiple disciplines like mixed-integer linear optimization and programming language research. \nAn easy job:\nWe\u2019re building a lot of things from the ground up for the first time. Working at Pylon is like a research project where you have to ship to intelligent, opinionated customers regularly. \nIt\u2019s basically guaranteed you\u2019ll be handed a task that is too difficult for you to do. You might fail sometimes. You might have no idea where to start. Our team leans heavily on each other, but there\u2019s no getting around the difficulties. \nWhat we are:\nA small team:\nWe don\u2019t have an army of engineers. If you find something is broken, you are probably the best one to fix it\nAll the code we write has to punch above its weight in maintainability and toil reduction\nIf you have a good idea, you have much more ability to put it into action than at a large company\nWe need generalists: specialization is for big companies that already have everything figured out. If you\u2019re smart, flexible and like getting into everything, we want you. \nWorking in a regulated space:\nMortgage is regulated both federally and at the state level. \nWe move fast, but breaking things isn\u2019t an option. \nAbout The Job\nBasics\nJob title: Software Engineer - New Grad\nStock options: own a piece of the company and we all win together\nHealth insurance, dental, etc. \nOur technology stack:\nWe don\u2019t require that you\u2019ve worked with any of these technologies before, this is just our stack for your information:\nTypescript front and backend\nWeb components\nGraphQL\nPostgreSQL\nNestJS web framework\nNx build system\nSagittarius\nAWS stack using CDK for declarative infrastructure\nWe currently use ECS rather than Kubernetes. If you have questions about this choice and want to know more, please apply!\nGeneral philosophy: monolith until it hurts. If we can do something without introducing a new service, we will\nAbout Pylon\nThe $13 trillion mortgage industry at the core of the American economy runs on broken assembly lines with human-powered workflows, stitched-together software, and a series of capital markets intermediates. The costs to originate are at an all time high despite foundational shifts in technology.\nPylon is rewiring mortgages from the ground up. We are building the only API-first, programmatic infrastructure that fully automates credit, compliance, capital, and operations.

    "desc": "Check out our Series B announcement here!\nWho We Are\nOur mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.\nAt Roboflow, we\u2019re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 1M+ developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow\u2019s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.\nOur team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: \u201cRoboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.\u201d We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.\nWe\u2019re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 63 million from Y Combinator, Google Ventures, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.\nWe\u2019re looking for strong technical generalists to contribute to our core product and help us build the foundation for our rapidly expanding company.\nWhat We're Looking For\nPrimarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You\u2019re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You\u2019re eager to \u2018do the work,\u2019 big and small.\nYou\u2019re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.\nYou\u2019re motivated by the question, \u201cHow can I improve this?\u201d and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.\nMany Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.\nWhat You'll Do\nYou'll be tasked with a wide range of projects. Each engineer has a realm they focus on, but we're still small enough that we don't have the luxury of deep specialization. We're looking for technical generalists that aren\u2019t afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises (but JavaScript and Node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase).\nMost of the things we work on are parts of the core product (which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment) but from time to time we're also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects.\nYou'll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to our strategy decisions. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit.\nThe majority of our codebase is written in JavaScript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some machine learning infrastructure on AWS. We're increasingly using Docker (both internally and for customer facing products like our edge inference server). A lot of our code runs in the browser (including some Tensorflow JS) but we're also working on building APIs and client libraries in several languages.\nYou certainly don't need to be experienced in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team.\nWe\u2019re especially keen to add some rigor to our processes and build the foundation for rapidly scaling the engineering organization (for example: we currently have limited tests and are not using an opinionated front-end framework -- things that will need to change over the coming months in order to be able to seamlessly expand the team).\nExample Projects\nCreating a filtering interface so our users can mix and match their images based on metadata like the time of day they were captured, the GPS location, or custom tags they've applied.\nExpanding our annotation tool to support new functionality (like polygonal annotations image segmentation).\nIntegrating the core app with external APIs for things like outsourcing annotation tasks and analyzing deployed model performance.\nStreamlining our onboarding flow.\nDeeper integrations with our other products like Roboflow Universe and our REST API.\nNext-generation model assisted labeling.\nOptimizing speed and scalability.\n\ud83d\udcc5 Within one month, you will\u2026\nSpend the first week onboarding in person with your manager (you'll come to our NY or SF Hub!)\nStart building a trusting relationship with your peers, and learning the company structure.\nShip a substantial new feature to an end user or to our team within your first week\nBuild your first Roboflow computer vision product (if you haven't already)\n\ud83d\udcc5 Within six months, you will\u2026\nAttend your first all company onsite\nBe ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.\nWho You'll Be Working With\nOur team of ~60 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others.\nYou will directly be working with our Engineering Lead and a team of Full Stack Engineers.\nWhere You'll Work\nRoboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City and San Francisco (and plan to open more as we grow density in new cities). We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a $4000/yr travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs (we offer a relocation bonus), work from home, work at co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best!\nWhen You'll Work\nRoboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you\u2019ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed.\nWhat You'll Receive\nTo determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every 6 months to ensure we stay in line with the market.\n\ud83d\udcb0 The target compensation for this role is $165,000 base salary.\n\ud83d\udcc8 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights:\nA $4000 Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work with alongside other Roboflowers.\nA $350 Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high - speed internet at home or a co-working space.\nCoverage of up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family.\nEquity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision and Roboflow.\nNot sure if this is you?\nWe want a diverse, global team with a broad range of experience and perspectives. If this job sounds great, but you\u2019re not sure if you qualify, look into our Former Founders role or subscribe to our career newsletter by emailing \"Subscribe\" to operations[at]roboflow.com. We carefully consider every application and will either move forward with you, find another team that might be a better fit, keep in touch for future opportunities, or thank you for your time.\nLearn More About Us\nWe are building a diverse Distributed team that is distributed across the globe. Roboflow is an equal opportunity workplace; we welcome people from all backgrounds, communities, and experiences.\nWe provide competitive compensation and stellar benefits to accelerate your personal and work life.

    "desc": "Warp: We're Building the Platform for Agentic Development\nWarp began with the vision of reimagining one of the fundamental dev tools\u2014the terminal\u2014to make it more usable and powerful for all developers. As AI has advanced, Warp has evolved beyond its terminal roots into the platform for Agentic Development: a workbench for dispatching agents to code, deploy, and debug production software.\nWith over 700k active developers and revenue that has grown over 20x this year so far, Warp is now one of the fastest growing startups in the exploding AI development space. We believe that soon developers will be \"tech leads\" for groups of agents; rather than opening a code editor to write code or a terminal to write commands, they will open Warp and prompt their computer to build features, fix bugs, and diagnose production issues.\nWith its starting point as a reimagined command line, Warp is well-positioned to support agent-first workflows: It sits at the lowest level in the dev stack, has access to all of a developer's context, and is set up for multitasking and long-running processes. In addition, Warp has state-of-the-art code editing features and built-in team knowledge sharing. It's the right interface for the agentic future.\nOur mission has remained the same even as AI has advanced: to empower developers to ship better software more quickly, freeing them to focus on the creative and rewarding aspects of their work.\nFor more information on our team and culture, we highly recommend reading our How We Work.\nAs a Software Engineer, you will\u2026\nParticipate in all aspects of software development activities, including design, coding, code review, unit/integration testing, bug fixing, and code/API documentation.\nCollaborate closely with the rest of engineering and other stakeholders from our growth, marketing, and product teams to plan features and build a high-quality product that elevates the productivity of all developers.\nImprove Warp's performance and reliability by building new features or polishing existing product parts.\nPrototype ideas and concepts to get quick feedback from internal and external users\nWork across the entire technical stack to ensure users have the most efficient and delightful Warp experience. The features you develop will span all aspects of the user experience, making you an expert on their needs.\nBe a mentor and provide thoughtful feedback to your peers, and build strong personal connections with your teammates!\nYou may be a good fit if...\nYou are passionate about helping developers get more done \u2014 would jump at the chance to work on this particular product\nYou have amazing engineering chops, but are also product- and user-focused\nYou have great communication and collaboration skills\nYou're sensitive to developers' needs, and can develop warm relationships with developers\nBonus:\nBuilding native apps in Rust or WASM\nShell or Linux-programming\nServer-side programming in go\nOpenGL, WebG, or other graphics programming\nAt Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description \u2013 we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.\nIf you're feeling playful, try out our optional hiring challenge and submit your answers with your application: https://github.com/warpdotdev/hiring-challenge\nSalary Transparency\nTotal compensation at Warp consists of two parts: 1) a competitive base salary, and most importantly, 2) meaningful equity.\nWhen we find the right person, we try to put our best foot forward with an offer that excites you. We consider what you'd like to be paid, the skills and level of experience you bring, what similar jobs pay, and make sure there's equal pay for equal work among those you'll be working with. The budgeted compensation amount for this role is targeted at $145,000 - $260,000.\nIn addition to salary, all employees receive further compensation in the form of equity in the company. This is a meaningful stock option grant with a four-year vesting period and one-year cliff. Your equity is where most of the significant upside potential is. Comparing startup equity is always a bit tricky, so we're happy to walk you through different valuation scenarios at the offer stage in order to help paint a clearer picture of the upside.\nFinal total compensation is determined by multiple factors including your experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.\nWhat We Offer\nCompetitive Salary & Meaningful Equity \u2013 we will stretch to get the right talent on board\nFull Medical, Dental, and Vision Benefits for employees (80% coverage for dependents)\nFlexible remote-first culture, with optional office spaces in NYC and SF for folks who want to work together IRL \nPre-tax FSA Health Savings Plan\nPre-tax Commuter Benefit\n20-days of Paid Time Off\nUnlimited Sick Time Off\n12 US Holidays\n16 weeks of paid Parental Leave for both birthing and non-birthing parents\nTwice-a-year company retreats\nMonthly gym and internet stipend\nGuideline 401(k)\nComplimentary OneMedical membership\nIndividuals seeking employment at Warp are considered without regards to race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\nAbout Warp\nWe are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.\nWe value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and the culture of our engineering team, please take a look at our internal 'How We Work' guide.\nWe're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms.

You will be responsible for adhering to our software development best practices and code quality standards.\nFrom a day-to-day perspective, you will participate in our fully Agile development process including daily agile standups, iteration planning meetings, and retrospectives. You will write code that is deployed to the cloud via a fully automated DevSecOps pipeline.\nThe ideal candidate desires to learn new technologies (frontend, backend, database, and CI/CD) and best development practices from outstanding senior developers.\nTechnologies (Note: a developer who has experience in one or more of these technologies could be a good candidate.

We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning.\nPay Range\nThere are a host of factors that can influence final salary including, but not limited to, geographic location, Federal Government contract labor categories and contract wage rates, relevant prior work experience, specific skills and competencies, education, and certifications. We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.\nFlex Time\nNorthstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John's IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.\nIndividual Benefits Account (IBA)\nTo attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset - the employee.\nThe purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:\nIBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee's monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee's salary.\nProfit Sharing Plan (PSP)\nThe PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee's behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee's compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.\nStock Options\nBecause Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.\nLifelong Learning\nOur culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.\nJoin Our Talented Team\nWe hire the BEST employees and value each one. Since 2021, The Washington Post has recognized Northstrat among its \"Top Workplaces\". We think that your friends and family will like it here too, so we offer employee referral incentives.\nNorthstrat is an Equal Opportunity Employer \nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace.

    "desc": "About Us\nAt Sierra, we\u2019re creating a platform to help businesses build better, more human customer experiences with AI. We are primarily an in-person company based in San Francisco, with growing offices in Atlanta, New York, and London.\nWe are guided by a set of values that are at the core of our actions and define our culture: Trust, Customer Obsession, Craftsmanship, Intensity, and Family. These values are the foundation of our work, and we are committed to upholding them in everything we do.\nOur co-founders are Bret Taylor and Clay Bavor. Bret currently serves as Board Chair of OpenAI. Previously, he was co-CEO of Salesforce (which had acquired the company he founded, Quip) and CTO of Facebook. Bret was also one of Google's earliest product managers and co-creator of Google Maps. Before founding Sierra, Clay spent 18 years at Google, where he most recently led Google Labs. Earlier, he started and led Google\u2019s AR/VR effort, Project Starline, and Google Lens. Before that, Clay led the product and design teams for Google Workspace. \nWhat You\u2019ll Do\nDesign and deliver production-grade AI agents: You'll build and ship highly performant, reliable, and intuitive AI agents that are central, mission-critical and drive revenue directly to Sierra's growth. These aren't prototypes\u2014they are powerful, scalable systems running in production environments across industries like finance, healthcare, and commerce.\nDrive the Agent Development Life Cycle (ADLC): You'll have complete ownership and autonomy from initial pilot through deployment and continuous iteration. You'll be responsible for building, tuning, and evolving AI agents in production environments, defining the standard for ADLC best practices along the way.\nPartner with large enterprises and cutting-edge startups: You\u2019ll work directly with leaders at some of the world\u2019s largest enterprises to understand their most pressing business challenges, and build AI agents that transform how they operate at scale. You'll also partner with the most cutting-edge startups in Silicon Valley, embedding AI agents across their entire business stack to drive innovation and efficiency.\nBuild the future of the platform: Your direct work with customers will guide the evolution of Sierra's core platform. You'll surface unmet needs, prototype new tools and features, and collaborate with research, product, and platform to shape the future of AI agent development and Sierra's product.\nExample projects\nThese are some examples of projects that engineers on our team have worked on recently:\nDesign and build AI agents for large telecommunications and media companies that consistently outperform human agents in managing subscription churn\nDevelop and refine AI agents capable of navigating complex customer interactions, like troubleshooting a broken device and personalizing product recommendations\nCreate generalizable AI agent frameworks tailored for industry-specific use cases. See some examples in our financial services blog!\nFacilitate design partnerships for new product initiatives, such as new agent architectures, self-service capabilities, and generative agent development\nExperiment with the latest voice models and figure out how to integrate them at scale to enterprise-grade customers\nWhat You'll Bring\nExperience building and scaling end-to-end production systems\nStrong technical problem-solving skills, especially in fast-changing, ambiguous environments\nA builder and tinkerer\u2019s mindset with high agency - you find creative ways to overcome obstacles and ship\nComfort working directly with customers to understand their needs and solve real-world problems\nExcellent communication skills - clear, direct, and persuasive across technical and non-technical audiences\nEven better...\nExperience building or deploying AI/LLM systems in production\nHave been a founder or founding engineer - you know what it means to balance craft, ownership, and speed\nFamiliarity with tools that power today's AI agents: eval frameworks, agent tooling, RAG pipelines, and prompt engineering\nPrior experience with React, TypeScript, and/or Go\nPrevious roles where you interfaced with customers or led technical projects with external stakeholders\nOur values\nTrust: We build trust with our customers with our accountability, empathy, quality, and responsiveness. We build trust in AI by making it more accessible, safe, and useful. We build trust with each other by showing up for each other professionally and personally, creating an environment that enables all of us to do our best work.\nCustomer Obsession: We deeply understand our customers\u2019 business goals and relentlessly focus on driving outcomes, not just technical milestones. Everyone at the company knows and spends time with our customers. When our customer is having an issue, we drop everything and fix it.\nCraftsmanship: We get the details right, from the words on the page to the system architecture. We have good taste. When we notice something isn\u2019t right, we take the time to fix it. We are proud of the products we produce. We continuously self-reflect to continuously self-improve.\nIntensity: We know we don\u2019t have the luxury of patience. We play to win. We care about our product being the best, and when it isn\u2019t, we fix it. When we fail, we talk about it openly and without blame so we succeed the next time.\nFamily: We know that balance and intensity are compatible, and we model it in our actions and processes. We are the best technology company for parents. We support and respect each other and celebrate each other\u2019s personal and professional achievements.\nWhat We Offer\nWe want our benefits to reflect our values and offer the following to full-time employees:\nFlexible (Unlimited) Paid Time Off\nMedical, Dental, and Vision benefits for you and your family\nLife Insurance and Disability Benefits\nRetirement Plan (e.g., 401K, pension) with Sierra match\nParental Leave\nFertility and family building benefits through Carrot\nLunch, as well as delicious snacks and coffee to keep you energized \nDiscretionary Benefit Stipend giving people the ability to spend where it matters most\nFree alphorn lessons\nThese benefits are further detailed in Sierra's policies and are subject to change at any time, consistent with the terms of any applicable compensation or benefits plans.

Transactions in these markets are complex. Critical, nuanced legal terms are woven into lengthy documents. These documents must be digested and analyzed by many different parties over the course of a single transaction and multiple decisions are made based on the terms laid out and quantitative and qualitative attributes within. This fundamental need plus a booming market drives enormous demand for precise extraction and benchmarking of legal terms.\nWhy We Need You\nOur customers operate within a constellation of enterprise tools\u2014document management systems, identity providers, fine-grained access managers, and an ever-expanding roster of platforms. The Nexus team exists to establish Noetica as the central node of that graph; ensuring seamless onboarding and maximizing insights for our customers.

Your work keeps information moving, customers delighted, and innovation accelerating inside a rapidly evolving market.\nHere's What You'll Be Doing\nAs a Software Engineer, Backend at Noetica, you'll be a key player in building the robust foundation of our groundbreaking platform. You will:\nCraft elegant data bridges.

Craft back-pressure-aware pipelines that respect flaky networks and strict rate limits while still achieving near-real-time freshness. \nCollaborate across disciplines. Pair with ML researchers, product managers, and fellow platform engineers to design contracts that are clear, composable, and future-proof. \nRaise the bar. Champion code quality, testing strategy, and sustainable operational practices that make on-call a non-event. \nRequired Qualifications\nYou have a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or a related field (or equivalent experience). \nYou\u2019re well-versed in object-oriented design and familiar with functional programming principles. \nYou are proficient in relational database technologies, modern Python, and concurrency models. \nHands-on knowledge of AWS (or another hyperscaler), containerization, and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS). \nFamiliarity with modern auth standards (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML) and secret management. \nExperience designing and operating production-grade backend services that integrate with third-party REST or gRPC APIs. \nYou are a strong communicator, eager collaborator, and self-starting problem solver, eager to learn alongside a team of world class ML researchers. \nPreferred Qualifications\nYou are interested in language and economics. \nYou have worked in single-tenant architectures. \nYou\u2019ve implemented change-data-capture or delta-sync patterns at scale. \nYou\u2019re comfortable with data-engineering concepts (Parquet, Protobuf, streaming queues, Airflow/Prefect). \nYou are motivated by having high impact and the growth that comes from moving quickly and adapting to an emerging product landscape. \nYou\u2019ve wrangled rate-limited or eventually consistent partner APIs and built clever ways to maintain synchronicity within the rules. \nCompensation\nThe reasonably estimated yearly salary for this role is $140,000-$209,000 USD. You will also be entitled to receive a significant early stage equity package and benefits. Individual pay decisions are based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, and skillset.\nBenefits\nWe offer numerous employee benefits, including:\nHybrid in-office schedule\nAmazing office location next to Bryant Park/Grand Central\n401(k) retirement plan\nWellhub (Gympass) fitness membership\nUnlimited PTO\nUnlimited sick days\nMedical, dental, and vision insurance\nCompany offsites\nCommuter benefits\nEqual Opportunity Employment\nWe are an equal opportunity employer.

But these new-school companies rely on old-school technology to manage their debt capital.\nThink months of legal coordination, countless versioned Excel files passed around via email, and weeks of follow-ups\u2014all culminating in a 200-page credit agreement that only lawyers understand, even though the future of the business depends on complying with it.\nThe inefficiency of this process can delay\u2014and in some cases block\u2014access to capital when it's needed most. It\u2019s time for the next generation of financial infrastructure builders to rise to the challenge.\nFinley\u2019s software helps startups streamline the debt capital raise and management process. That way, they can spend more time focusing on their customers and less time worrying about fundraising.\nThe Role\nWe\u2019re looking for Software Engineers to join our Engineering team. As an early employee, you\u2019ll be responsible for designing, building, and testing an entirely new category of capital markets software from the ground up. You\u2019ll architect and build the infrastructure that helps fintechs around the world collectively manage billions of dollars. Just as importantly, you\u2019ll help shape the engineering culture and trajectory of a seed-stage startup.\nWe\u2019re looking for 0 \u2192 1 individuals who are comfortable with autonomy early on and also excited to help build structures that will scale their own impact over time. In other words, we\u2019re looking for candidates who want to build a lasting company just as much as they want to build industry-changing software.\nWe believe in finding the best technology for the job, and being disciplined with only adopting the tools that actually let us move faster, build more securely, and enable a higher quality of life. We hate inefficiency and embrace debate to constantly find ways to make our lives easier and products better. Our tech stack (see below) reflects that philosophy.\nYour Responsibilities\n You will be responsible for helping architect, build, and scale the first lender-borrower relationship platform for the debt capital markets. - You will work with the team to design, product manage, and test early features for the Finley system. - You will become an expert in information security, data engineering and API design in a heavily regulated space. - You will become an expert on structured finance (no worries, we\u2019ll fill you in!) and the ways in which technology can bring standardization to a field accustomed to legacy solutions. - You will help grow the Finley team by helping interview job candidates, mentor new engineers, and document standard operating procedures.\nOur tech stack\n Backend : NodeJS + Express, Apollo Server, Typescript - Frontend : React + Hooks, Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo Client - Database : Postgres + Knex - Infrastructure and deploys : AWS, Docker, ECS, CDK, CodePipeline - Collaboration : Github, Papertrail, and Trello\nWe're looking for\n Builders. You have experience building web applications for 3+ years and can scope and ship products independently. - Problem-solvers. You focus on delivering outcomes and prefer to use the right tool for the job, rather than building for building\u2019s sake. (That said, getting excited about a modern tech stack built on Node.js, React, and AWS wouldn\u2019t hurt. See above.) - Collaborators. You like collaborating with Business, Design, and Product functions in addition to other engineers, and you believe that the best solutions can only emerge when everyone has a seat at the table. - Systems thinkers. You enjoy the complexity of designing for a range of stakeholders (think borrowers, lenders, and banks) and source systems. You get excited about designing for the long-term. - Team-builders. You look forward to helping recruit, train, and mentor a team of engineers at Finley.",

Today we process over 100,000 pages of records every month, and we\u2019re scaling rapidly toward millions.\nThe Role\nAs a Founding Engineer, you\u2019ll work directly with the founders on everything from backend systems to frontend UX. You\u2019ll help us take real customer problems and quickly design, build, and ship solutions. Some days you\u2019ll be polishing a UI for attorneys, paralegals, and nurses, other days you\u2019ll be designing schemas for medical records at scale, or even joining customer calls to understand their workflow deeply. We have plenty of work across net new features, backend scalability, and ML/AI Agent research.\nThis is a role for someone who wants ownership, variety, and velocity \u2014 and who\u2019s excited to help scale a product from thousands to millions of pages per month.\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\nBuild end-to-end features: design, implement, and ship customer-facing functionality across the stack.\nOwn product polish: take responsibility for usability, frontend/UX details, and design taste (even if you\u2019re still learning it).\nThink in trade-offs: help us balance speed vs. scalability, polish vs. delivery.\nCollaborate directly with customers: understand their pain points, demo prototypes, and iterate fast.\nDesign for yourself: All of our engineers spend significant time using the product and polishing it to taste. You will develop opinions about the best workflows and have the chance to build them for yourself to make the product better for others.\nScale systems: help us move from 100k \u2192 1M \u2192 10M pages/month.\nShape engineering culture: define early practices, tooling, and technical bar as one of the first engineers on the team.\nWhat We\u2019re Looking For\nStrong software engineering background (we\u2019re open to language/framework mix).\nComfort working across the stack (frontend, backend, ops) \u2014 or excited to get there quickly.\nInterest in frontend/UX/design and building intuitive user experiences.\nAppetite for ambiguity \u2014 you want to wear multiple hats in a small, high-velocity environment.\nStrong communication skills \u2014 you can explain technical decisions and work closely with founders and customers.\nBonus: Experience building in AI/ML products, insurance, healthcare, or legal tech.\nOur Tech Stack\nFrontend: TypeScript + Tailwind CSS\nBackend: Python (FastAPI)\nAI/ML: OpenAI APIs for document understanding and summarization\nInfrastructure: AWS (S3, RDS/Postgres, etc.)\nWhy Join Us\nImpact from day one: Your work will directly shape the product and company trajectory.\nIn-person culture: Work side by side in NYC on a lean, fast-moving team. Option for hybrid work after month 1.\nOwnership: Equity + decision-making power as one of the first hires.\nGrowth: Opportunity to grow into tech lead, product owner, or any role that excites you as we scale.\nAmbition: We\u2019re scaling from 100k \u2192 1M \u2192 10M pages/month, and you\u2019ll be at the center of making that possible.\nMission: Modernize the medical-legal industry with meaningful, AI-powered technology.\nCompensation\nBase Salary range $130k-$200k + generous early-stage equity package.\nHealth, dental, and vision benefits.\nEarly-stage upside: join as one of the first 5 employees and shape the company.\n\ud83d\udc49 This role is perfect for someone who\u2019s \nexcited about startups and wants to learn how to build a business from 1 -> 100 (and new product features from 0 -> 1)\n.\nWhy We\u2019re Building InQuery\nEvery medical-legal case runs on records. A workplace accident, a car crash, a surgery \u2014 each one generates documentation that grows from a single note into thousands of pages spanning ER visits, specialists, physical therapy, diagnostics, billing, and often years of prior history. These records touch everyone: adjusters, attorneys, physicians, case managers, vendors, and regulators. They form the backbone of medical-legal work.\nThe problem is that the system hasn\u2019t kept up with the scale or complexity. Records arrive as PDFs, scans, handwritten notes, and exports from dozens of systems. They\u2019re duplicated, out of order, or commingled across accidents and even patients. Reviewing them is almost entirely manual \u2014 adjusters copy-paste into spreadsheets, attorneys build timelines by hand, and nurses or paralegals spend 10\u201315 hours organizing a single file. It\u2019s slow, expensive, and error-prone.\nThe consequences are real: missed details affect case outcomes, duplicated services inflate costs, and bottlenecks limit how many cases a team can handle. At scale, this inefficiency means fewer cases resolved, slower settlements, higher costs, and overworked staff.\nAt InQuery, we believe this work doesn\u2019t have to be this painful. We\u2019re building technology that takes unstructured records and makes them structured, searchable, and usable. Our system retrieves, segments, organizes, and augments records; extracts the structured data professionals actually need (providers, diagnoses, procedures, codes); and produces outputs like chronologies and timelines that teams can trust. The goal isn\u2019t to replace human judgment \u2014 it\u2019s to give experts the bandwidth to apply their skills where it matters most.\nWe\u2019re already processing over 100,000 pages a month. By the end of this year, we need to scale to 1 million, and by 2026, 10 million. If you care about building reliable systems that solve messy, real-world problems \u2014 and about helping professionals in law, insurance, and healthcare do their jobs better \u2014 this is the place to do it.",

    "desc": "tl;dr\n: we're looking for a world-class full-stack/backend engineer who loves simplifying complex systems, unifying fragmented data, and building high-scale systems. Learn more about us here (link).\nWhy join us?\nEarly-stage, yet de-risked: we are a rare combo of being early stage (high upside) but lower risk (2XX+ paying customers, $Xm+ recurring revenue, cash-flow positive for over a year, hockey-stick growth). You get the benefits of an early stage startup without the risk you\u2019ll have at almost any other startup. You\u2019ll have a ton of impact, work directly with our customers, and get to work on interesting technical challenges you won\u2019t see at bigger companies. Although we\u2019re early stage, we\u2019ve eliminated key strategic risks you\u2019ll face at other startups. Like an unproven product, lack of market validation, lack of revenue, over-reliance on VC funding, co-founder disputes. We\u2019re all young and hungry. Our team is fully in-person, tenacious, and committed - most of us moved to SF from far away (Canada, SoCal, Texas, Virginia) specifically to build Agave from the ground up.\nTeam is technical, diverse, young: you'll work with a formidable founding team that's experienced, intense, and ambitious. We've worked together for 10 years, first at a startup that Amazon acquired, then at Amazon, and now at Agave. You'll learn a ton while having outsized ownership. You\u2019ll have a front-row seat to the good and bad of building a company from the ground up. We\u2019re also technical - almost 90% of our team have either majored in CS, worked as full-time devs, and/or worked in technical roles at startups and larger tech companies for 5+ years before moving into business roles at Agave.\nHuge opportunity without direct competition: startups are incredibly hard, so you want to join one that has a unique advantage. You don\u2019t want to spend years of your life on a company in a saturated market with tons of competition. We\u2019re seizing an opportunity that\u2019s massive (Construction is the world\u2019s third-largest industry) but also overlooked by most people in startup land. Most who can solve this problem aren\u2019t aware it exists or are too distracted by tech trends (blockchain, metaverse, LLMs, etc.) to notice. These talented folks get coaxed into building products that seem cool early on, but don\u2019t solve durable problems or aren\u2019t differentiated enough against their many competitors to be sustainable (e.g. lots of AI products), so they end-up not going anywhere or stagnating without a clear plan to grow profitably. As a result, we have a multi-year head start against potential competitors, increasing our odds of success significantly. We\u2019re also backed by world-class investors (Accel, YC) and Construction insiders (Procore and Autodesk executives, founders of the largest construction tech companies like PlanGrid).\nRequirements\nBack-end/full-stack engineer, ideally with 1-4 years experience (we're open to exceptional college grads with strong intern/co-op experience).\nFamiliarity with cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS).\nSelf-motivated, high ownership, low ego; desire to work on a fast-paced, intense, fun team. Excited to be our next hire; passion for building a world-class engineering culture.\nPumped to work in-person with us in SF 5 days/week.\nNo need to have: prior experience with our tech stack or at B2B SaaS/API company\nInteresting technical challenges?\nUnification: we\u2019re unifying dozens-to-hundreds of fragmented systems under a single standard that we define. Our unification covers data objects, data models, authentication, account-linking UX, and features like filters and pagination. When designing any new feature, we have to do it in a scalable way. For example, when adding filters, we have to research each system we support (and plan to support) and create a generic, system-agnostic solution.\nOn-prem: we\u2019re connecting with many types of on-prem systems (SQL-based, DLL-based, API-based), many built 20-40 years ago. We provide tremendous value to customers allowing them to interface with these systems in a secure, fast, reliable way, as if they\u2019re modern, cloud-based products. We need to support real-time communication and webhooks when they don\u2019t exist (e.g., using web-sockets).\nScale & speed: we\u2019re handling millions of API requests per day, and growing daily. For our products that we power with our own API (e.g. Analytics), we need to store and retrieve large amounts of data in an efficient way, building elegant caching layers to reduce latency. We ship code daily and iterate quickly based on actual feedback from paying customers (they share tons!).\nOperational excellence: we\u2019re creating a reliable API layer on top of many old systems that don\u2019t have APIs. It\u2019s like building a skyscraper on quicksand, enforced by SLAs. We need to innovate in expanding the depth and breadth of our integrations while simultaneously increasing our development velocity. We need to be very creative in how to continually test our code and integrations, creating scalable testing frameworks that can catch edge cases and bugs across 1k+ endpoints.\nMix of back-end and front-end: we\u2019re building front-end apps that dog-food our own APIs (e.g. Sync, Analytics). This helps us build world-class APIs because we suffer any pain present in our API. We\u2019re building both the lego blocks and the higher-level lego models: we see what kinds of APIs our SaaS customers want, then also look at the kinds of API niceties we want for our own applications (like a caching layer, advanced filtering) and implement a combination of the two.\nVariety: without knowing, you might assume adding a new integration is low-ambiguity and routine. But each integration we launch is special, completely different and posing unique challenges. This requires researching that system and its nuances in great depth before building on top of it. It\u2019s part engineering, part archeology.\nTech stack?\nTypeScript, React, Redis, Postgres, AWS - CDK, EC2\nBenefits\nHealthcare: we cover 90% of your healthcare costs with several plan options.\n401k: we match 100% of your contributions, up to 4% of annual salary.\nRelocation: sizable relocation bonus for folks currently located outside of the Bay Area, and a bonus for anyone (even within the Bay Area) who moves within a 15-minute walk of our office.\nGym: on-site gym with Peloton, squat rack, Tempo, Yoga setup, and more.\nVisa: we sponsor Visas (H1B, TN, etc.) for candidates who are a good fit!\nCommuter benefits: employees can make pre-tax contributions toward commuting costs, and we\u2019ll cover the full cost of a Muni pass for those using public transit.\nIn-Person\nWe've built Agave in-person since day 1, and will maintain an in-person culture in San Francisco going forward. We form tighter bonds, build a stronger culture, and move faster since we're all working from one location.\nOur office is at 101 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco, right near Salesforce Park, coffee shops & restaurants, and a bustling downtown. We believe building in-person is a huge strategic advantage, and we hope you\u2019ll join us.",

No excuses, no blame-shifting \u2014 if something needs fixing, we own it and make it better. This means stepping up, even when it\u2019s not \u201cyour job.\u201d If a ball is dropped, we pick it up. If a customer is unhappy, we fix it. If a process is broken, we redesign it. We don\u2019t wait for someone else to solve it \u2014 we lead with accountability and expect the same from those around us.\nCraftsmanship \nPutting care and intention into every task, striving for excellence, and taking deep ownership of the quality and outcome of your work. Craftsmanship means never settling for \u201cjust fine.\u201d We sweat the details because details compound. Whether it\u2019s a product feature, an internal doc, or a sales call \u2014 we treat it as a reflection of our standards. We aim to deliver jaw-dropping customer experiences by being curious, meticulous, and proud of what we build \u2014 even when nobody\u2019s watching.\nWe are \u201cmajos\u201d\nBe friendly & have fun with your coworkers. Always be genuine & honest, but kind. \u201cMajo\u201d is our way of saying: be a good human. Be approachable, helpful, and warm. We\u2019re building something ambitious, and it\u2019s easier (and more fun) when we enjoy the ride together. We give feedback with kindness, challenge each other with respect, and celebrate wins together without ego.\nUrgency with Focus\nCreate the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. Move fast, but in the right direction. We operate with speed because time is our most limited resource. But speed without focus is chaos. We prioritize ruthlessly, act decisively, and stay aligned. We aim for high leverage: the biggest results from the simplest, smartest actions. We\u2019re running a high-speed marathon \u2014 not a sprint with no strategy.\nTalent Density and Meritocracy\nHire only people who can raise the average; \u2018exceptional performance is the passing grade.\u2019 Ability trumps seniority. We believe the best teams are built on talent density \u2014 every hire should raise the bar. We reward contribution, not titles or tenure. We give ownership to those who earn it, and we all hold each other to a high standard. A-players want to work with other A-players \u2014 that\u2019s how we win.\nFirst-Principles Thinking\nStrip a problem to physics-level facts, ignore industry dogma, rebuild the solution from scratch. We don\u2019t copy-paste solutions. We go back to basics, ask why things are the way they are, and rebuild from the ground up if needed. This mindset pushes us to innovate, challenge stale assumptions, and move faster than incumbents. It\u2019s how we build what others think is impossible\nThe personal data provided in your application and during the selection process will be processed by Happyrobot, Inc., acting as Data Controller.\nBy sending us your CV, you consent to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of evaluating and selecting you as a candidate for the position.

    "desc": "At Pylon, we\u2019re a small team building a very ambitious product in the mortgage space.\nAt this early stage, we\u2019re looking for engineers who can see the opportunity of what we\u2019re building towards and want to shape the user experience of a deeply technical product.\nWe're in search of full stack engineers who love turning complexity into clarity and who sweat the details in service of usability, performance, and craft. If you thrive on building fast, expressive interfaces and care deeply about the experience behind every click, Pylon could be a great place for you.\nAbout You\nYou:\nCare about the full stack, but specialize in the last mile. You know CSS like the back of your hand \u2014but you can reason across the stack and know how to integrate cleanly with backend systems. \nHave strong product instincts. You think in flows, not just components. You\u2019re motivated by how users feel, how quickly they understand something, and whether they trust what they see. \nEmbrace constraints. Designing great UX in a highly regulated, high-stakes domain is a hard problem. You\u2019re energized by solving for clarity in a complex space. \nKnow your tools and push them hard. Whether it\u2019s squeezing performance out of a rendering path or designing a type-safe form builder, you love building polished, maintainable UI code that scales. \nWork autonomously and with impact. You don\u2019t wait around for perfect specs or throw pixels over the wall. You collaborate tightly with engineers, designers, and PMs to build and iterate quickly. \nLove strong typing. We use TypeScript across the stack and care a lot about types as a tool for correctness, clarity, and iteration speed. You probably do too. \nAbout The Team\nWhat we\u2019re not:\nBuilding a CRUD app: \nWe\u2019re building a platform that\u2019s only possible due to deep technology investments and thinking hard from first principles. Cargo-culting what\u2019s come before won\u2019t be sufficient. If you\u2019re looking to do mostly plumbing / lego piece assembling, Pylon may be very frustrating for you\nAn LLM wrapper: \nMortgage is a sprawling mess of problems, and there isn't one tool that solves every one of them. We use LLMs, but we've reached for tools in multiple disciplines like mixed-integer linear optimization and programming language research.\nAn easy job: \nWe\u2019re building a lot of things from the ground up for the first time. Working at Pylon is like a research project where you have to ship to intelligent, opinionated customers regularly. It\u2019s basically guaranteed you\u2019ll be handed a task that is too difficult for you to do. You might fail sometimes. You might have no idea where to start. Our team leans heavily on each other, but there\u2019s no getting around the difficulties.\nWhat we are:\nA small team: \nWe don\u2019t have an army of engineers. If you find something is broken, you are probably the best one to fix it. All the code we write has to punch above its weight in maintainability and toil reduction. If you have a good idea, you have much more ability to put it into action than at a large company.\nWe need generalists:\n Specialization is for big companies that already have everything figured out. If you\u2019re smart, flexible and like getting into everything, we want you.\nWorking in a regulated space: \nMortgage is regulated both federally and at the state level. We move fast, but breaking things isn\u2019t an option.\nAbout The Job\nBasics\nJob title:\n Full Stack Engineer\nStock options:\n Own a piece of the company and we all win together\nBenefits:\n Health insurance, 401K, dental, etc.\nOur technology stack:\nWe don\u2019t require that you\u2019ve worked with any of these technologies before\u2014this is just our stack for your reference:\nTypeScript (frontend and backend)\nWeb Components & React\nGraphQL\nNx build system\nPostgreSQL\nSagittarius\nAWS stack using CDK for declarative infrastructure\nNestJS on the backend\nIn this role, you\u2019ll:\nBuild and own core workflows that define how users interact with Pylon\nCollaborate closely with design and backend to ship high-impact features\nBring structure, clarity, and polish to complex forms and workflows\nWrite clean, well-typed code that balances speed and maintainability\nHelp evolve our frontend architecture as the product grows\nPush for consistency and usability across the interface\nWork to evolve our mortgage GraphQL API\nAbout Pylon\nThe $13 trillion mortgage industry at the core of the American economy runs on broken assembly lines with human-powered workflows, stitched-together software, and a series of capital markets intermediates. The costs to originate are at an all time high despite foundational shifts in technology.\nPylon is rewiring mortgages from the ground up. We are building the only API-first, programmatic infrastructure that fully automates credit, compliance, capital, and operations. For the first time, originators can build and scale mortgage businesses entirely through software, not people. Our team comes from Stripe, Better, and Affirm, and we are backed by Conversion Capital, QED, Citi, Fifth Wall, Peter Thiel, and the founders of Ramp, Mercury, Blend, and others.",

We train vision models to read those documents the way a human would, and make it possible to build products, train models, and automate processes at scale.\nWe\u2019ve grown incredibly quickly, from zero to mid 7 figure ARR in 1 year, and now work with hundreds of companies ranging from leading AI teams (Harvey, Vanta, Scale), through to enterprise (FAANG, top 3 trading firm).\nWe\u2019re also backed by world class investors like Benchmark and First Round Capital, and are looking for a Software Engineer to build on and improve our core product.\nThe Opportunity\nAs a member of our founding team you\u2019ll work on our core API and on prem deployments.

This isn\u2019t an inconvenience\u2014it\u2019s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.\nTraditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs\nOCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.\nReducto Breaks Document Layouts Into Subsections And Then Contextually Parses Each Depending On The Type Of Content.

With high quality software as our ultimate engineering objective, our key tactic is automation: \n\t\u2022 \nWealthfront software automates the financial services we provide to our clients, and within these services we automate the collection of data that we learn from on our way to making our services even better.\n\t\u2022 \nWealthfront engineers function as builder/operators, with dual responsibility for building the system and operating it in production. Any toil that this brings about is automated away by engineers. This investment in automation is expected, and the prioritization of it is always built into our planning and execution.\n\t\u2022 \nWealthfront engineers automate our development processes. For example, Wealthfront engineers automate all of our testing. Manual testing is not part of the software development lifecycle at Wealthfront.\n\t\u2022 \nWealthfront engineers automate observability in case of failure. If something is up, our systems inform engineers appropriately. If our systems are quiet, they are healthy.\nIf you are drawn to being an engineer within such an environment, and having outsized impact as an engineer at a magnitude that is only available within a company achieving greatness at our size (~250 employees, half in engineering), then we want to hear from you!\u00a0\nAbout the Role\nWe are looking for backend engineers to join our core product development teams.

You\u2019ll ensure that mission critical backend systems and services operate smoothly in production by triaging and resolving operational issues as part of a team of on-call engineers. You\u2019ll proactively identify opportunities for improving the reliability and scalability of our systems.\nAdditionally, you might play a part in evolving the engineering organization by participating in recruiting activities such as interviewing and attending career fairs and providing mentorship to other engineers on the team.\nAbout You\nYou have 2-6 years of experience in developing backend components, services or APIs in Java or a similar language. You demonstrate knowledge and understanding of distributed systems and functional programming paradigms. You have knowledge of SQL and experience working with online data stores (ideally something like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server but NoSQL is okay).\nYou have passion for agile, test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing. You also have a passion for working on platforms and backend systems that have measurable business impact and like working in a fast paced cross functional environment.\nWhile not required, experience working with Spark pipelines is a plus along with knowledge of an ORM technology such as Hibernate.\u00a0 Another plus is working with a dependency injection framework (one of Guice, Spring, Pico, Dagger).\nYou have either a BS or MS in computer science or related field.\nOnce you join, Wealthfront will: \nPair you with a mentor who will guide you through our structured onboarding program\nEncourage you to work on projects that match your professional goals\nSupport your professional development by providing feedback during weekly 1:1s and our semi-annual reviews\nProvide you autonomy so you can be a happy and successful member of our team\nEstimated annual salary range: $140,000 - $185,000 USD plus equity and a discretionary bonus. \nBenefits include medical, vision, dental, 401K plan, generous time off, parental leave, wellness reimbursements, professional development, employee investing discount, and more!\nAbout Wealthfront\nHere at Wealthfront, our mission is to create a financial system that favors people, not institutions.

    "desc": "About Us\nHere at Tarro we build products that empower small brick and mortar restaurants by liberating them of the operational burden of running their business. We accomplish this by providing a frictionless connection between them and their customers through our multi-product ecosystem offering AI-enabled order taking, delivery enablement, payment solutions, and point-of-sale software. At Tarro, we use a combination of bits (technology) and atoms (people) to solve real world problems facing small business owners.\nWe obsess over placing our customers first and working backwards from there. When our customers succeed, we succeed. The restaurant industry in the US is over a $1 trillion total addressable market (TAM), but remains relatively underserved by technology.

As of our last fundraising round in mid-2022, we were valued at $450M and have since seen substantial growth across customer acquisition, product development and company headcount.

A small group of legacy clearinghouses process the majority of these transactions, offering consolidated connectivity to carriers and providers.\nStedi is the world's only programmable healthcare clearinghouse.

    "desc": "Who We Are \nNeuroFlow CEO and West Point graduate Christopher Molaro served in the army for five years, including a tour in Iraq as a platoon leader. Coming back home, he experienced firsthand the gaps in the behavioral health system and how veterans and civilians alike face too many barriers when it comes to receiving appropriate, timely care.\nWhile pursuing his MBA at Wharton, Chris met his future co-founder Adam Pardes, and the two agreed \u2013 even the most engaging digital mental health apps in the world wouldn't truly change the problem; only a solution that systematically integrated behavioral health into the full healthcare ecosystem could create meaningful change. And so they created NeuroFlow.\nWhat We Do:\nWe pride ourselves on partnering with healthcare leaders to assist in driving better outcomes, lowering total cost of care, and making behavioral health risk more predictable and transparent. NeuroFlow exists to make sure no one who needs behavioral health support falls through the cracks.\nWe build more than just engaging digital health tools for self-care: we create platforms that identify population behavioral health risk early, engage individuals with acuity-specific resources, and enable care teams to make smarter and more efficient decisions. Together, NeuroFlow's solutions arm healthcare organizations with the insights they need to overcome the systemic challenges in today's healthcare ecosystem.\nHow We Do It:\nThe award-winning culture at NeuroFlow is one built around encouragement and daring to be great. Our core values have been displayed in our office since day one, and each team member is responsible for carrying out these values and keeping each other accountable to them. We succeed through our flexibility and agility, navigating and transforming an industry ripe for change where \"no\" or \"can't\" is too often the default. NeuroFlow offers unique opportunities to work in a fun and challenging fast-paced environment with direct, meaningful impact on helping to close the divide between mental and physical health.\nGeneral Application:\nWe are growing quickly so if one specific job doesn't stand out to you this is a great place to apply without a specific job!\nWhat We Believe:\nNeuroFlow is a proud equal opportunity employer. Every day we are working to tackle the mental health crisis in America, and in order to do that well, we need diverse voices, experiences, and perspectives at the table. As an equal opportunity employer, we prohibit any unlawful discrimination against a job applicant on the basis of their race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, family or parental status, disability*, age, veteran status, or any other status protected by the laws or regulations in the locations where we operate. We respect the laws enforced by the EEOC and are dedicated to going above and beyond in fostering diversity across our workplace.\nApplicants with disabilities may be entitled to reasonable accommodation under the terms of the Americans with Disabilities Act and certain state or local laws. A reasonable accommodation is a change in the way things are typically done which will ensure an equal employment opportunity without imposing undue hardship on NeuroFlow. Please inform our Talent team if you need any assistance completing any forms or to otherwise participate in the application process.\nAs a HIPAA compliant organization \nAll team members shall:\nAct in accordance with NeuroFlow's Information Security Policies. \nProtect organizational assets from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction or interference. \nReport security events or other risks to the organization \nExecute organizational security processes or activities \nPerform security responsibilities that defined and communicated for their role \nBe responsible for their actions regarding the security of organization",

By doing this, we let 9-1-1 dispatchers focus their \ntime\n and \nenergy\n where it\u2019s needed most: actual emergencies.\nNationwide, the average emergency communications center (ECC) is 30% understaffed. Staffing shortages have lead to call-taker burnout and attrition, which is exacerbating the problem even more. Post COVID, wait times for 9-1-1 calls have reached a boiling point; imagine, in the most stressful situation of your life, waiting on hold for over a minute.\nBut what\u2019s most shocking is \n60-80%\n of the calls 9-1-1 operators take aren\u2019t even emergencies. They\u2019re administrative calls that have been punted to ECCs: noise complaints, lost dogs, paying parking tickets, etc. Our conversational AI answers these administrative calls, reducing hold times, and freeing up human operators to deal with emergent situations.\nAurelian is currently live in centers across the country, and answers thousands of non-emergency calls every day. We are hiring people to help us continue to scale and make real positive impact on public safety infrastructure in the US.\nAbout The Role\nAs a Backend Engineer at Aurelian, you will be part of a team building state of the art, multi modal conversational AI systems that help save lives. You\u2019ll own and relentlessly improve core features of our platform, and get to work closely with our customers to develop novel solutions to the unique problems that 9-1-1 call centers face.\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\nSome of the things we\u2019re working on right now include:\nScaling our systems and infrastructure to handle millions of voice interactions\nLeveraging AI agents to streamline integration with legacy systems\nMaking voice AI interactions as natural as human conversation\nDeveloping intuitive user experiences for human in the loop workflows\nWhat You Need\nExperience with Python - knowledge of async patterns is a plus\nFamiliarity modeling complex data and building scalable systems\nA strong sense of ownership - you should care deeply about your work and what we deliver to customers\nA track record shipping - you should know what it takes to rapidly ship production ready features\nCommunication skills - you should be able to effectively communicate and collaborate with non-technical teammates and customers\nBenefits\nMedical, dental & vision insurance coverage\nUnlimited PTO\nWFH stipend for home office\nRelocation stipend",

    "desc": "San Francisco\n Full-time\n In-person\nAbout Solidroad\nBuilding something great is addictive. It\u2019s like discovering your favorite TV show mid-season, except you're helping write the next episode. It\u2019s like unboxing a new gadget, except you\u2019re the one designing it. You shape how it feels, how it works, and how people react when they use it.\nAt Solidroad we're solving a big, messy, exciting problem: how do you scale customer support without losing what makes humans amazing? Warmth, empathy, intuition. We\u2019re using AI, generative tech, and real-time simulations to make this happen. It's ambitious, difficult, and genuinely new.\nAbout The Role\nWe're looking for someone early in their career who sees this role as signing up for a job and a hobby. Or signing up for a job and a triathlon. Or a job and a language course. It\u2019ll challenge you, stretch you, and fill your life in the best way possible. You\u2019ll write code (full-stack, frontend, backend, it's all on the table), learn more in a month than you might in a year elsewhere, and probably ship something important faster than you expect. Sometimes it'll be uncomfortable, but you'll also have moments of genuine \"wow, we built that\" pride.\nWhat You'll Actually Do Day-to-day\nBuild Advanced Prompt Engineering and Retrieval Pipelines\\ Help us handle thousands of customer conversations daily, across integrations like Zendesk, Intercom, and Salesforce. You\u2019ll build cutting-edge generation pipelines to deliver instant insights and accurate scoring of interactions.\nCreate Real-Time Multimodal Simulations\\ Build engaging, realistic training experiences across voice, video, and chat using tools like OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and Vapi. These interactive scenarios dynamically adapt to user input, making training feel authentic and effective.\nCraft High-Performance User Experiences\\ Use Next.js to build intuitive, lightning-fast UIs capable of handling complex AI interactions smoothly. You\u2019ll create polished interfaces that run seamlessly, even when things get technically challenging.\nOur Team & Culture\nWe\u2019re a small, focused group working full-time in our San Francisco office. We\u2019re here five days a week because building something ambitious means collaborating closely, solving problems together, sharing ideas spontaneously, and occasionally challenging each other to padel matches, cold plunges, or karaoke evenings. We're intentional about creating a culture that's mature, supportive, and fun. You'll be joining experienced founders who've done this before, alongside a tight-knit team genuinely excited about building something impactful.\nWe hope you\nSpent a bit of time at a startup (Series A to C ideally), so you know the thrill and the chaos that comes with early-stage building.\nHave solid computer science foundations, whether through formal education or teaching yourself obsessively.\nBuilt something cool that made you proud. Maybe it's popular on GitHub, maybe it\u2019s an app your friends actually use, or maybe it's still half-broken but you're excited to finish it. Whatever it is, we\u2019d love to see it.\nThe good, the bad, and the honest truth\nThe highs here are incredibly high, direct mentorship from founders who\u2019ve done this before, lots of autonomy, and a product you'll feel proud of. The lows are that you'll need to move fast, make decisions with incomplete info, and sometimes work through messy problems alone. But the reality is that startups are a bit like a sport or an instrument: you invest in it not just because you have to, but because you genuinely want to be better tomorrow than you are today.\nIf that sounds exciting, don\u2019t second-guess yourself. Get in touch. Send us something you\u2019re proud of (GitHub, personal site, anything goes) and a short note about who you are and why this feels right to you. Enthusiasm and drive count more here than a long CV.",

    "desc": "About The Company\nEnduring Labs is an SF-based company backed by First Round Capital. We are building Mason, an AI-native property manager.\nWe are growing our engineering team. You\u2019ll love the role if you are bold, want to impact the lives of real Americans, and love to build.\nWhat We\u2019re Solving\n15 million single-family homes are rented in the United States, 50% of which are professionally managed. Owners are promised freedom from the details, a quality vendor network for maintenance, and an available line for tenants. But they are met by unanswered calls, challenging tenants, and unreliable vendors.\nEnter Mason. Mason is an infinitely patient, detail-oriented assistant to owners, partner to vendors, and resource for tenants. In a job where communication is 90% of the battle, Mason is a landlords secret weapon.\nRenters call or text Mason 24/7. Mason troubleshoots live, brings in the right help, while keeping owners in the loop. Give us a call at 415-605-0275 to hear Mason at work.\nThe Role\nWe are hiring an engineer to help us extend Mason past his roots in maintenance. To be successful, we need to handle the end-to-end journey of a property under management. And there is a sh*t-ton to be built.\nYou\u2019re a Fit If\nYou trust yourself to take a big swing - engineers push to prod and balance the tradeoffs of what might break. You\u2019ll have the autonomy to decide your approach and standards of development. There is no bureaucracy in between you and your code being live.\nYou sweat the details - small differences in context, prompts, and system design can cause wild variations in agent performance. If you enjoy the descent into database tables, integrations, and logs, you\u2019ll do great.\nYou want to know the end user - we are building for real people! Our customers could be anywhere and are real homeowners, tenants, and contractors. We love to show up and get to know them. We\u2019ll drive to Sacramento, fly to Nevada, and do whatever it takes to get in front of our customers.\nYou have a generalist skillset with a back-end bias - you have the toolkit to build across the full stack but are excited about problems that require orchestrating systems, managing pipelines, etc.\nThe Technical Challenge\nMulti-Step LLM Reliability - LLM\u2019s unlock the ability to handle an issue with complete autonomy. As we build long-running processes chaining dozens of LLM calls together, reliability starts to become a challenge.\nIntegrations & Context Extraction - our customers live in their own bespoke systems. Property details, owner preferences, and vendor relationships are buried in text conversations, notes, and invoices. We will need to integrate with these systems, learn what we can, and provide continuity to our customers' operations as we take over progressively more work for them.\nMulti-party workflows - we need to orchestrate conversations amongst vendors, owners, tenants, in-person agents, and many other parties. These workflows are non-determined, complex, and extremely context-dependent.\nWhat We Value\nConsistency compounds - We show up every single day. Even when it\u2019s hard. Effort compounds over time.\nAction over speculation - Brains are powerful machines, but prone to speculation. Do something instead of thinking something \u2014 thoughts do not yield new information, action does.\nHealth is foundational - A good company comes from a collection of good minds, and goods mind require healthy people. We strive for health, not only for ourselves but also for our peers.\nLearn often and always - Skill issues are solvable \u2014 anything can be learned with desire, mentorship, and repetition. If we aren\u2019t growing, we\u2019re dying.\nWho We Are & Funding\nWe are in-person five days a week in San Francisco. We have a beautiful office near the Embarcadero and will do anything to maximize the probability of success in finding PMF (small team, high information throughput, focused).\nFounder & CEO\nNitin Gupta \n- Nitin is the Founder and CEO of Enduring Labs. He\u2019s grown multiple startups from the Seed / Series A stage to $1B+ outcomes including Newfront Insurance (BizOps) and Pave (Product + GTM Leader).\nFounding Engineer\nMichael Aspinwall \n- Michael is Enduring Labs\u2019 Founding Engineer. He is focused on building delightful and scalable systems. He was previously an ML Engineer at Amazon Web Services and graduated from Cornell University with a degree in Math and Computer science.\nWe raised an over-subscribed seed round led by Bill Trenchard at First Round Capital (Silicon Valley's top seed fund, with investments in Square, Roblox, Notion, and Uber) with participation from BoxGroup, WndrCo and a group of world-class angels.",

We believe that more startups should exist and that founder-led companies are more successful in the long term. With Pulley's cap table management tools, companies can better understand and optimize their equity for the long term. Starting a company is hard enough. Managing equity shouldn't be.\nAs AI reshapes how companies operate, we're exploring what equity management looks like in an AI-native world. We believe there's an opportunity to redefine how early-stage leaders build and manage their companies. It's a brand-new, unsolved challenge\u2014and we're building a solution that leverages our strengths to meet it.\nOur trajectory is fueled by top investors like Founders' Fund, Stripe, General Catalyst, Caffeinated Capital, 8vc, Elad Gil, among other great angels.

If you like pushing yourself to learn a massive amount while shipping code that has a huge impact on the end product, Pylon Engineering could be a great place for you.\nAbout You\nYou:\nHave strong opinions that you\u2019re willing to defend. We have a culture of vigorous discussion and debate on technical decisions. We\u2019ll push you to defend your choices, and we want you to push back. \nDon't settle. Challenge yourself to frequently and consistently deliver exceptional code. If something could be better, take the initiative to improve it. \nHave great ideas, and lots of them. You should see opportunities all around you to make the code, product and infrastructure better. We\u2019ll give you an environment where you can act on those ideas. \nAre self-motivated. You can take a goal and drive towards it without needing extensive hand-holding. The team is supportive and loves to share knowledge and advice, but there\u2019s no time for micromanaging your work. \nAre comfortable with ambiguity. There's a million ways to do things; you should feel at ease making a decision under uncertainty while balancing competing constraints. \nAre confident you can learn quickly. Mortgage is complex, our platform is complex, good software engineering is complex. You\u2019ve got to have an attitude that you can absorb it, get on top of it, and build something better than what came before. \nLove strong typing. We're a team full of people who love Haskell and Rust (and Idris!) and take pride in pushing Typescript to its limits. \nAbout The Team\nWhat we\u2019re not:\nBuilding a CRUD app:\nWe\u2019re building a platform that\u2019s only possible due to deep technology investments and thinking hard from first principles. Cargo-culting what\u2019s come before won\u2019t be sufficient. \nIf you\u2019re looking to do mostly plumbing / lego piece assembling, Pylon may be very frustrating for you\nA ChatGPT wrapper:\nMortgage is a sprawling mess of problems, and there isn't one tool that solves every one of them. We use LLMs, but we've reached for tools in multiple disciplines like mixed-integer linear optimization and programming language research. \nAn easy job:\nWe\u2019re building a lot of things from the ground up for the first time. Working at Pylon is like a research project where you have to ship to intelligent, opinionated customers regularly. \nIt\u2019s basically guaranteed you\u2019ll be handed a task that is too difficult for you to do. You might fail sometimes. You might have no idea where to start. Our team leans heavily on each other, but there\u2019s no getting around the difficulties. \nWhat we are:\nA small team:\nWe don\u2019t have an army of engineers. If you find something is broken, you are probably the best one to fix it\nAll the code we write has to punch above its weight in maintainability and toil reduction\nIf you have a good idea, you have much more ability to put it into action than at a large company\nWe need generalists: specialization is for big companies that already have everything figured out. If you\u2019re smart, flexible and like getting into everything, we want you. \nWorking in a regulated space:\nMortgage is regulated both federally and at the state level. \nWe move fast, but breaking things isn\u2019t an option. \nAbout The Job\nBasics\nJob title: Software Engineer\nStock options: own a piece of the company and we all win together\nHealth insurance, 401K, dental, etc. \nOur technology stack:\nWe don\u2019t require that you\u2019ve worked with any of these technologies before, this is just our stack for your information:\nTypescript front and backend\nWeb components\nGraphQL\nPostgreSQL\nNestJS web framework\nNx build system\nSagittarius\nAWS stack using CDK for declarative infrastructure\nWe currently use ECS rather than Kubernetes.
